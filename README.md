//Simran, describe your project here and how a symbol table is used in your implementation.

I am working independently.

I plan on representing amino acid synthesis through the use of symbol tables (DNA to RNA transcription and RNA to amino acid translation). 

EXPLANATION OF THE TRANSCRIPTION + TRANSLATION PROCESS
The first step in transcription is the partial unwinding of the DNA molecule so that the portion of DNA that codes for the needed protein can be transcribed. Once the DNA molecule is unwound at the correct location, an enzyme called RNA polymerase helps line up nucleotides to create a complementary strand of mRNA. Since mRNA is a single-stranded molecule, only one of the two strands of DNA is used as a template for the new RNA strand.

The new strand of RNA is made according to the rules of base pairing:
DNA cytosine pairs with RNA guanine
DNA guanine pairs with RNA cytosine
DNA thymine pairs with RNA adenine
DNA adenine pairs with RNA uracil

After transcription, the new RNA strand is released and the two unzipped DNA strands bind together again to form the double helix. Because the DNA template remains unchanged after transcription, it is possible to transcribe another identical molecule of RNA immediately after the first one is complete. A single gene on a DNA strand can produce enough RNA to make thousands of copies of the same protein in a very short time.

In translation, mRNA is sent to the cytoplasm, where it bonds with ribosomes, the sites of protein synthesis. Ribosomes have three important binding sites: one for mRNA and two for tRNA. The two tRNA sites are labeled the A site and P site.
Once the mRNA is in place, tRNA molecules, each associated with specific amino acids, bind to the ribosome in a sequence defined by the mRNA code. tRNA molecules can perform this function because of their special structure. tRNA is made up of many nucleotides that bend into the shape of a cloverleaf. At its tail end, tRNA has an acceptor stem that attaches to a specific amino acid. At its head, tRNA has three nucleotides that make up an anticodon.

An anticodon pairs complementary nitrogenous bases with mRNA. For example if mRNA has a codon AUC, it will pair with tRNAâ€™s anticodon sequence UAG. tRNA molecules with the same anticodon sequence will always carry the same amino acids, ensuring the consistency of the proteins coded for in DNA.
